MAIN SUCCESS SCENARIO,
The Report user requests a population report,
The user selects the scope:,

Region,
Country,
The system retrieves all population records that match the selected scope.,
The system calculates:,
Total population of each continent/region/country,
Total population living in cities (and % of total),
Total population not living in cities (and % of total),
The system generates the report containing the following columns:,
Name (Continent/Region/Country)

The report is presented to the report user
the report user provides the population distribution report to the organisation
EXTENSIONS,

,
If the user does not select a valid scope (Continent, Region, or Country), the system prompts the user to choose one before continuing.,
If the user enters a continent or region name that does not exist in the database, the system displays a message such as “No such continent/region found” and does not run the report.,
No country records returned
,
If no records are returned from the report users' query, the system shows an error message.,
